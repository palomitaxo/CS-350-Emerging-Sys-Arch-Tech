# CS-350-Emerging-Sys-Arch-Tech

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The documents I chosen are not the best works of mine to be very transparent but the reason why I chose them I will dive deeper! First off, to address the prompt, one assignment is an introductory assignment, preparing us for the course and being able to set up our enviroment directly to ensure we are set up for success for the rest of the course. The second assignment is showing my understanding of best coding standards and ensuring that as an individual can I understand the importance of sticking to these best coding practices and why it is very important for ensuring the safety, security, and reliability of the codebase which is relevant to any position I may fall under.

What did you do particularly well?
Now the part I am excited for! Why did I choose the work I did? A little backstory on assignment 1, although minor in face front, I had the most difficult time with. I truly mean staying up for days, trying to configure a new software I have no prior knowledge or experience with. I had to research, watch tutorials, reach out to my instructor, use my own personal colleagues, the direct software help desk, I was facing all of this and using all resources and all this taught me was persistance, perserverance and collaboration with others!

Where could you improve?
My understanding of syntax, and writing of formal language.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
CppCheck and CodeComposer are new tools I can now say I have experience with :)

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Collaboration, skills around code structure, my understanding of embedded systems will come in handy in the future moving forward.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Leaving comments, explaining what section is doing what and where the source is coming from and just overall proper notation is essential for me!
